	<h1>Composite Example</h1>
	<p>This example plug-in demonstrates basic usages of the diagram
		composite API introduced with Graphiti 0.10.0. This API allows clients
		to add Graphiti diagrams to views or other UIs so that users can
		display and edit the diagrams there.</p>
	<p>
		The example plug-in <i>org.eclipse.graphiti.examples.composite</i> is
		available as executable but also as source in the SDK download and
		within our repository under the examples folder. It demonstrates the
		basics of placing diagrams into other locations than editors.
	</p>
	<h2>Diagrams in View</h2>
	<p>
		The plug-in adds a view <i>org.eclipse.graphiti.examples.composite.view.DiagramCompositeViewExample</i>
		to the Eclipse views extension point and to the Graphiti test
		perspective. The view is populated with a Graphiti <a
			href="../../../javadoc/org/eclipse/graphiti/ui/editor/DiagramComposite.html">DiagramComposite</a>
		that will display a diagram that is stored locally in the plugin (<i>test.diagram</i>
		in the root folder of the plugin). The URL of that diagram is
		hard-coded in the view and cannot be replaced. In a real usage
		scenario the handling would of course be similar to the handling of an
		editor. An operation to show the view is triggered on a diagram e.g.
		in the context menu of the Project Explorer, the diagram URI is
		retrieved and passed to the composite.

	<p>The only other things that this simply example cares about is
		delegating the focus and adapter retrieval mechanism (both standard
		Eclipse) to the diagram composite. For a real usage scenario much more
		is needed, e.g. the view does not care about changes that are done to
		the diagram in the view; users can modify the diagram but there is no
		way to persist them.</p>
	<h2>Diagrams in a Popup</h2>
	<p>
		The plug-in also adds a dialog that can be invoked by a context menu
		entry in the project explorer (select two Graphiti diagrams with <i>.diagram</i>)
		file extension and select the entry <i>Show Diagrams in Popup</i>) to
		display the two selected diagrams side-by-side in a popup.
	</p>
	<img alt="Screenshot of the Diagrams Popup" src="images/DiagramPopup.png"
		width="600px">
	<p>
		The implementation of the popup is in the class <i>org.eclipse.graphiti.examples.composite.dialog.DoubleDiagramDialog</i>
		and is also kept very simple; e.g. just as the views example it does
		not care about persisting any changes the user did to the diagrams on
		the popup. It simply takes two resources (the diagram files), tries to
		extract a diagram URI for each and created a <a
			href="../../../javadoc/org/eclipse/graphiti/ui/editor/DiagramComposite.html">DiagramComposite</a>
		passing the URI.
