<h1>Non-EMF Domain Objects</h1>
<p>By default Graphiti supports domain models from the EMF world and offers automated 
support for reacting to changes and updating the editor or viewer. Since not only EObjects 
but simple POJOs can be passed to all relevant framework APIs, it is also possible 
to use non-EMF domain objects with Graphiti. This page describes the differences 
the user of Graphiti has to deal with when using non-EMF domain models.</p>
<h2>Domain Model Change Notifications</h2>
<p>Of course the framework cannot support automated notification to changes in such 
domain models, so the tool builder needs to hook an appropriate listener into the 
framework. Here&#39;s the process how to do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create an appropriate specific domain listener class. As an example you 
	can have a look at <span class="inlinecode">DomainModelChangeListener</span> 
	in the Graphiti framework; this class does this job for EMF models.</li>
	<li>Subclass <span class="inlinecode">DiagramBehavior</span> and override its 
	method <span class="inlinecode">registerBusinessObjectsListener</span>. In that method create
	an instance of your listener from step 1 and register it.</li>
	<li>Create an appropriate notification service class by subclassing
	<span class="inlinecode">DefaultNotificationService</span> or implementing its 
	interface. An instance of this class is used by the framework to get the connection 
	between domain objects and their graphical representation (method
	<span class="inlinecode">calculateLinkedPictogramElements</span>) and triggers 
	the actual update of the graphical representation in the diagram (method
	<span class="inlinecode">updatePictogramElements</span>) using the appropriate 
	update features. The class <span class="inlinecode">DefaultNotificationService</span> 
	does the job for EMF models.</li>
	<li>In your Diagram Type Provider implementation create and return an instance 
	of the class from step 3 within the method <span class="inlinecode">getNotificationService</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Support for Undo and Redo</h2>
<p>For standard EMF domain models users do not need to care about implementing undo/redo 
functionality within their features. This is all cared about by the framework by 
using EMF <span class="inlinecode">TransactionalCommandStacks</span> and
<span class="inlinecode">RecordingCommands</span> for executing features. But in 
case users have domain models implemented in another technology than EMF, they need 
to care about implementing undo/redo for their domain model changes by themself. 
(The changes done to the graphical representation (Graphiti<em> PictogramElements</em> 
and <em>GraphicsAlgorithms)</em> are still handled automatically.)</p>
<p>In order to provide undo/redo for non-EMF domain models users can implement the 
new interface <span class="inlinecode">ICustomUndoableFeature</span> within their 
features. In case a feature implements this interface the Graphiti command stack 
will care about the EMF undo/redo and additionally to the standard EMF-undo/redo 
call the appropriate methods (<span class="inlinecode">canUndo</span> and
<span class="inlinecode">undo</span> resp. <span class="inlinecode">canRedo</span> 
and <span class="inlinecode">redo</span>) within the feature.</p>
<p>Inside the feature coding for those methods users can use the information passed 
(the executed feature instance will be called with the instance of its context) 
to undo the operations done while executing the feature. Within the features
<span class="inlinecode">execute</span> method users might add additional information 
needed to perform the undo to the context object.</p>
<p>The decision to implement <span class="inlinecode">ICustomUndoableFeature</span> 
can be taken individually for each feature.</p>
<p>For the pattern approach a similar interface has been introduced:
<span class="inlinecode">ICustomUndoablePattern</span>, for which the before mentioned 
also applies accordingly.</p>
<p>By introducing this functionality it is now possible for users of Graphiti to 
implement undo and redo functionalities also for non-EMF domain changes; nevertheless 
this functionality might also by used for EMF domain models in case they need to 
implement additional undo/redo functionality.</p>
<p>Still there is one thing to be aware of: All changes done inside the Graphiti 
diagram editor or viewer (no matter if EMF changes or non-EMF changes) will write an
<span class="inlinecode">IExecutionInfo</span> entry to the stack that will be available 
with the according feature and context for undo/redo. External changes (e.g. changes 
done from the standard property sheet) will not break the tool, but will not necessarily 
lead to data being available inside the <span class="inlinecode">IExecutionInfo</span> 
object written:</p>
<ul>
	<li>EMF changes done on the EMF command stack (e.g. from the standard property 
	sheet) have no associated feature and context. Therefore an empty
	<span class="inlinecode">IExecutionInfo</span> entry will be written. On the 
	other hand all changes done in that case will automatically be undone/redone 
	by the EMF command stack, so there should be no need to do additional stuff</li>
	<li>Non-EMF changes done e.g. from a standard property sheet will naturally 
	not go through the EMF command stack of the tools, so no
	<span class="inlinecode">IExecutionInfo</span> stack entry will be written (in 
	fact also no EMF command stack entry will be written so there is no issue within 
	the tool). In this case users are responsible to add their own undo/redo functionality 
	relying on whatever technology they use for their domain model.</li>
</ul>
