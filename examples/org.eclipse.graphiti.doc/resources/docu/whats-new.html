			<td class="content">The Graphiti Diagram Editor has been moved
				to a public package and has been reworked to offer a better and more
				understandable API now. It has been split into several classes to
				achieve a better separation of concerns and to avoid one huge <i>DiagramEditor</i>
				class. The different aspects have been separated into several <i>Default*Behavior</i>
				classes clients can exchange to modify the default behavior. The API
				has been cleaned up, unneeded methods have been removed, some
				methods have been made accessible to clients in cases where we see
				the need to modify the behavior of the editor. Also classes around
				the editor have have been reworked to be easier to understand and to
				be leaner. This especially affects the DiagramEditorInput, which has
				been stripped down to no longer hold a reference to the diagram
				object itself and an editing domain. It only holds a <i>URI</i> that
				can be used to gain hold of the diagram. The changes make it easier
				for clients to change the editor behavior while being able to reuse
				most or parts of the standard functionality. Another goal we wanted
				to achieve was to keep as much of the original API and functionality
				available (although probably moved to another class) to make
				adoption by clients as easy as possible. <b>Nevertheless this is
					a breaking change in non-API classes that were referenced by many
					users, so clients might need to adapt their coding after migrating
					to M5.</b>
