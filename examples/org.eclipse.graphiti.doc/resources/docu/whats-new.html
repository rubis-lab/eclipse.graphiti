<h1>Graphiti &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; for Indigo</h1>
<p>Last revised March 14, 2011</p>
<p>This document describes the new development topics that were
adressed during a milestone towards the release 0.8.0 within the Indigo
release train.</p>

		support for Non-EMF domain models</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">It is now possible to provide
		undo/redo functionality for operations onnon-EMF domain models. In
		order to implement this, users of the Graphiti framework can implement
		the new interface <i>ICustomUndoableFeature</i> with their features or
		the new interface <i>ICustomUndoablePattern</i> with their patterns.
		If they do so, the feature or pattern will be called as soon as an
		undo or redo is performed for this feature. For details on this new
		possibility see <a
			href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=324859">Bugzilla
		324859</a>.</td>

		<td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>User selection
		context in IDirectEditing APIs</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">So far the direct editing
		functionality in Graphiti was purely String-based. Entries in the drop
		down or for code completion could only be indentified by the String
		they were also represented in the UI to the user. Now it is possible
		to define and provide a proposal support class based on the new
		interface <i>IProposalSupport</i> based on additional information, e.g
		placed in the direct editing context. This can serve e.g. tool
		builders having to deal with different objects that have the name,
		like classes with the same name residing in different packages. For
		details on this new possibility see <a
			href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=324058">Bugzilla
		324058</a>.</td>

		<td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Round-offs and
		bugfixes</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Several smaller round-offs have been
		implemented:
		<ul>
			<li>Visualization during direct editing now completely fulfills
			the usability specification.</li>
			<li>Opening a user-contributed editor within <i>AbstractDrillDownFeature</i>
			has been made easier by providing a protected method to open and a
			specific editor for a given diagram.</li>
			<li>The framework is now prepared for users to deal with EMF
			objects that are equal in the sense of <i>EMFUtil.equals</i> but are
			not identical. For details on this new possibility see <a
				href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=335828">Bugzilla
			335828</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		Besides several bugs within the framework have been fixed.</td>

		<td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Connections on
		Connections</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">It is now possible to attach
		connections to other connections. The Graphiti metamodel offered this
		possibility already but the framework support for this was still
		lacking. Now, one can define so-called connection points to actually
		split existing connections. Technically these connection points are
		possibly active shapes that can be selected, moved or deleted as any
		other shape. As a tool builder you need to allow this new behavior
		when the user tries to drop a connection either via a <i>CreateConnectionFeature</i>
		or a <i>ReconnectConnectionFeature</i>. Example implementations are
		available in the Sketch testtool in the examples folder in the
		Graphiti CVS. <img src="images/NaNW-Indigo-M6-Connection.jpg" /></td>

		<td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Font Management</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Graphiti now manages the fonts that
		are used inside a diagram just the way it was already done for colors.
		This feature was introduced in order to improve the graphics handles
		usage and number of classes instantiated; multiple uses of the same
		font will now lead to only one instance of that font existing inside
		the diagram. Just as the colors fonts are now managed at Diagram level
		and no longer on the individual graphical elements. <b>Note: this
		is an minor incompatible change in the Graphiti API you will need to
		adapt to!</b> There are no font creation methods any more, instead you
		will need to call manageFont on the diagram. <b>Besides diagrams
		that were created using Graphiti versions before 0.8.0 M6 will need a
		migration</b> if tool defined fonts are used. The Graphiti framework
		provides a small migration utility that can be triggered at an
		appropriate time by the tool. We decided explictly against triggering
		the migration from the framework, because there will definatly by
		different requirements on the time of triggering in the various tool
		scenarios. Besides there will be tools that will need no migration at
		all and would be only suffer a time penalty from that check and
		migration being done in the framework. More details on the API change
		and the migrator can be found in the Bugzilla <a

		<td width="70%" valign="top">Graphiti supports printing and
		saving a diagram to an image. There have always been hooks were the
		user can influence the default behaviors for these operations.
		Nevertheless it was not clear if the way this was enabled was really
		feasible. An investigation of the two features that exist for those
		purposes (<i>DefaultPrintFeature</i> and <i>DefaultSaveImageFeature</i>)
		showed that tool builders can rudimentary implement behavioral changes
		to those features (like changing the selection in the editor), so it
		makes sense to keep the implementations available. The existing state
		was documented in the JavaDoc at the appropriate classes and methods
		and a not used property in the save context was removed. This
		functionality might be subject to further enhancement request as tools
		need more possibilities to influence the behavior.</td>
