/**
 * This interface is the wrapping container around the providers and Eclipse
 * parts involved with an editor. So by having access to this interface, it is
 * possible to retrieve every information which might be necessary to build on
 * this framework.
 * <p>
 * All providers and factories have access to the IConfigurationProvider, to
 * which they belong (backward-pointer). This is necessary, because the
 * providers/factories are sometimes dependent on each other. However, this
 * prohibits the usage of the same instance of a provider/factory in different
 * IConfigurationProviders.
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This class is not intended to be subclassed by clients.
