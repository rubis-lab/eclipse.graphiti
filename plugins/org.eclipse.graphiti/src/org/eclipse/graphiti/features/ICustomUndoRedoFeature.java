 * undo and redo. When a feature implements this interface, and the framework
 * performs an undo or a redo, the framework will call the contained methods.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface is especially helpful if customers want to
 * implement undo/redo functionality for non-EMF changes, e.g. for non-EMF
 * domain models. Note that any EMF-model change (including the changes done to
 * the graphical representation (Graphiti {@link PictogramElement}s and
 * {@link GraphicsAlgorithm}s will by handled automatically by the Graphiti
 * framework no matter if this interface is implemented by a feature or not. The
 * feature may use the context object (e.g. the contained properties set) passed
 * to the contained methods while executing the feature in order to collect any
 * information needed for undo.
